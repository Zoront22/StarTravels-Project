#START TRAVELS :fa-plane:

<p>
"**START TRAVELS**" is a comprehensive project designed to revolutionize how people plan their trips and acquire related services. The platform offers two types of personalized experiences: one for customers and another for vendors.

On the customer page, users have access to a wide range of services including: 
- Competitive prices.
- Detailed travel plans.
- High-quality images of the services offered.

- Detailed sales charts.

- The ability to add, activate, delete, and edit the services they offer.
- The platform facilitates payment management as well.
- Vendors can communicate directly with customers through messages.
- Receive and manage reviews of their services.
